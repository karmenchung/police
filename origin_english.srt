1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,879
It's go to San Francisco. It almost kind

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,200
of late. It's stop boardings right now.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,080
>> Okay.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,200
>> You may leave freely, but the currency

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,920
cannot.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,920
>> This situation appears straightforward,

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,920
almost routine, involving nothing more

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
than two passengers, a carry-on bag, and

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
a large amount of cash discovered at an

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
airport checkpoint. But as officers

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,320
begin asking questions and listening

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
carefully to the answers, it becomes

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
clear that this is not just about money,

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
but about identity, intent, and a story

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,400
that starts to unravel almost

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
immediately. On March 27, 2025, at

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,160
approximately 7:24 p.m., officers

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
responded to the West checkpoint at

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,079
Orlando International Airport after the

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
TSA alerted them to two passengers,

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,040
Yuzang Chen and Zin Miang, attempting to

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,039
conceal a significant amount of US

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,440
currency inside a carry-on bag. Chen and

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,680
Fang provide an explanation that sounds

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
detailed on the surface, but quickly

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,199
raises additional questions.

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,239
>> We're probably going to ask you some

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,600
questions.

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,879
>> How are you all?

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,239
>> Yeah, I understand there was some money

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,359
in your bag.

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
>> Uh, yes. I'm doing translate for him.

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,920
>> Okay. Who Who does the bag belong to?

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,960
>> Can I ask your

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,640
documentation for the money?

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,680
>> Only the only the only on the bank. We

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
get some money from our account and some

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
money is from casino.

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,920
>> Okay.

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,135
>> And this one take for the bank. [snorts]

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,799
>> It was all

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,079

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,479
>> This is I save you as your 195.

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,079
>> Explain me what he said.

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,000
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I didn't

account, that was the money that his

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
sister and his mother gave him.

98
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,440
>> Uhhuh.

99
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
>> Okay. And then the rest of it is from

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,920
the casino.

101
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,239
>> Yes.

102
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,840
>> Okay. And that was never deposited into

103
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
an account or anything.

104
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,080
>> Sorry,

105
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
>> the money from the casino was never

106
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
deposited into his account.

107
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,599
>> Yeah, they because they didn't they want

108
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,440
to give me the documents or the receipt.

109
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
They just say, "Okay, you got a card,

110
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,120
play a card and give me the money, but

111
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
they let us write a W9.

112
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
>> Do you have any of that paperwork from

113
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,120
the casino?"

114
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
>> No,

115
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,760
paper.

116
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
>> That's That's not possible. Yeah. Chen

117
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
and Fang are unable to produce any

118
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
receipt or proof that they actually won

119
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
the money. But this was just the

120
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
beginning of their problem. As officers

121
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,200
began the standard process of

122
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
inventorying the cash, they discovered

123
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
something even more incriminating.

124
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,879
>> They usually give you a receipt for your

125
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
earnings.

126
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
>> 102

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
>> about how much was it?

128
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
>> About 40,000. She has about 5,000. He

129
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
has about 40,000.

130
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,680
>> Okay.

131
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
>> About 15 16 of which she said was from

132
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,640
relatives. Another 15 from the casino.

133
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
All wrapped in rubber bands by CSA. No

134
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
documentation. He has he does have

135
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
transactions on his app for about

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,519
>> of the uh of the

137
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,120
>> for a few thousand. Yeah. For what he

138
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,000
got from the family.

139
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,480
>> Yeah.

140
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
>> But no documentation for the stuff from

141
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
the casino.

142
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,239
>> And where is your flight? Where's your

143
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,280
flight to?

144
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,519
>> It's go to San Francisco. It almost kind

145
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
of late. It stop boardings right now.

146
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
>> Okay.

>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
>> So you you are free to leave. The money

154
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
has to stay until we can investigate

155
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,360
further.

156
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
>> Okay.

157
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
>> So we have to make some notifications.

158
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600

to stay until we can do some

161
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,199
investigation.

162
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,320
>> We can.

163
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,919
>> So we're making a phone call.

164
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,400
>> Yeah.

165
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,919
>> To someone else. They're going to decide

166
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,360
if they want to come out and speak with

167
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,320
you further. If they don't, then you can

168
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,560
leave with the currency. Not a problem.

169
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,479
>> At this point, you're not detained. You

170
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,440
may leave freely, but the currency

171
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,120

176
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
minutes here now to determine if they're

177
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
going to come out. If they do not want

178
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
to come out, if they do not want to come

179
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,120

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,120

It's up to you if you're done.

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,639
>> Okay. I'll put it in.

or what?

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,839
>> Huh?

421
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
Hold on.

422
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,440
>> No. Left foot in first.

423
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,399
>> Can I put a disc?

424
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,720
>> Yeah, he's been pat down a couple times.

425
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,399
>> How about my cigarette?

426
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,160
>> What?

427
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,920
>> What's that? Those can't go to the jail.

428
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,079
>> Um,

429
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
>> I don't know um if cigarettes were

430
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
allowed to go to the jail. The

431
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
detectives put everything in your bag

432
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
now. Okay. And then whatever couldn't

433
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,079
go, they brought they gave it to your

434
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,839
your friend, your girlfriend.

435
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,680
>> Chen is escorted to a temporary

436
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
detainment area inside the airport. The

437
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,760
officers eventually discovered that Chen

438
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,000
does not have legal status to remain in

439
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,240
the United States and promptly the

440
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,000
immigration and customs enforcement were

441
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,720
notified. In the end, Yuzang Chen was

442
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
charged with fraud, impersonization,

443
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,720
creating or possessing fictitious

444
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
personal identification. But the

445
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,800
unanswered questions remain. Where did

446
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
he get the money from? And who and where

447
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,360
are the owners of the credit cards? But

448
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
regardless of the answers, it definitely

449
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
wasn't the best day for Chen.
